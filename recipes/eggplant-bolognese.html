    <h3>
        Italian recipes are my favorite especially when eggplant is included.
        This is a hearty bolognese and a paleo recipe that is prepared in one pot!
        You can add any of your favorite vegetables such as peppers or zucchini.
        You serve over spaghetti squash, zucchini noodles, or your favorite pasta! Enjoy!
